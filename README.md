Hello! I'm Loki. I'm a beginner in the code world.
These days I started to learn to program, I'm loving it, it's a little difficult for me, but with persistence, I'll make it.
My native language is Portuguese, but I'm currently learning English too.
That's all I think. I will update this when I learn something new or other things that I'm doing. Bye bye!
